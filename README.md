# 💬 Complete NLP Pipeline using Machine Learning

A full end-to-end **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** system built from scratch using **traditional machine learning**. This project supports real-world multi-task text classification such as **emotion detection**, **topic classification**, **spam detection**, and **toxicity analysis** — all without pre-trained LLMs.

> 🔍 Focus: Accuracy, efficiency, interpretability, and deployment-readiness.
